Two balls of light with illuminated contrails flying in formation at a constant altitude and heading.

We were flying west bound 50nm south of Sault Ste Marie Ontario, Canada at FL390. The sky was clear with the odd cloud formation below us. We noticed at our 1 oclock position, at approx our altitude two balls of light flying towards us. The balls of light were flying in a continuous formation and constant altitude, and each had an illuminated contrail. The lights continued on what seemed to to be a constant heading until they went by our right wing 10-40nm away. As they passed, the second light split into two separate lights, as if up until then one light was obscuring the other. When the lights reached our 5 oclock position they all disappeared. I would estimate that each light was 200-400 feet in diameter, and each contrail was illuminated for 2000-4000 feet. We notified ATC and they had no other aircraft in the area, or anything on radar. Also, another aircraft 100nm behind us at FL280 stated they had seen the same lights. Both myself and the other pilot have been flying for more than 25 years with over 10,000 hours each and neither of us has seen anything like it before.

NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with this airliner crew member, and found him to be an excellent witness.  We also spoke with the other cockpit crewmember, who submitted a report, as well.  Each person has flight time logged that is measured by the tens of  thousands of hours, and both of them have decades of experience in the cockpit of an airliner.  As witnesses to the event, they are superlative, in our opinion.  

Please see report from crew member of other airliner, who reported the same event.  PD))",,,0

3 objects seen at night by Airline crew at 28, 000 ft.

On a night flight from Hamilton Ontario Canada to Winnipeg Manitoba Canada at an altitude of 28,000 ft, 3 objects were seen in the sky by the 3 crew members in the cockpit operating the flight.  The objects were round with bright white lights and each had a long trail of white light turning to red with some blue.  Air traffic control had nothing on the radar but another aircraft reported that they saw the same thing as we did.  The other aircraft was at 39,000 ft and to them the objects seemed to be at that altitude, wehereas to us it seemed to be at our altitude of 28,000 ft.  After 1 or 2 minutes the objects suddenly vanished.",,,0

ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE OF REPORT))

Thanks for your reply Peter, and I apologize for not giving a specific date or coroberation.  I am however quite serious and no this is not an attempt at a hoax.  Like yourself I have a deep intrest in UFO's and there proper scinetific study.  So I would not peretrate a hoax.
 
So in response I would say it would have been in mid june-early july around 1997-1998.  I am working on contacting others who were with me that night to coroberate what was seen.
 
There is more to this story, but until I can cooberate the story, and change your view of this being a possible hoax.  I will keep that to myself.
 
I will work hard to get you more reports on the sighting and look forward to talking with you again.  I do understand your relucatance to believe me.  And I bear you no ill will because of it. 
 
Thanks again,
